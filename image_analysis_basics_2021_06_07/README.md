# Image analysis basics

This course addresses the basics of image analysis in Fiji/ImageJ. We
will use an interactive approach to explore image filtering, simple
segmentation, object measurements, and batch processing. We will
conclude with a hands on activity. If time permits, then we will
introduce attendees to tools necessary to start self-teaching
Python-based image analysis.
